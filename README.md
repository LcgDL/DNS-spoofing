# DNS-spoofing
DNS spoofing using Python, the scapy library for packet manipulation and netfilterqueue to interact with network traffic.

netfilterqueue: Allows network packets to be accessed from the operating system (requires the system to have iptables configured to redirect packets to a netfilterqueue).

scapy: A powerful library for creating, manipulating and analyzing network packets.


The code is an example of a DNS spoofing attack, which can be used in penetration testing or Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
